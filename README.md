never seen before, this software written by A. Richardson April 1, 2010 -- August 19th, 2010 while funded as an M.Sc. student by Dr. R. Illner at the department of mathematics and statistics (u. victoria), is a fresh interpretation of a command-line utility "scg" (which stands for S. Cloude graphics) written at Natural Resources Canada under the supervision of D. Goodenough and H. Chen. The author is thankful to the above gentlemen for inspiring a lifetime interest in mathematical modelling, remote sensing, image analysis, and computer vision. 

the command-line utility "scg" implemented a similar algorithm and was intended for radar data, and included special features for visualizing radar data, inspired by Dr. S. R. Cloude and the radar image visualisation techniques promoted by him. 

this software produced results shown in the 2010 IGARSS conference presentation, which led to an invitation by Prof. Eric Pottier (u. Rennes) to submit the same software to the ESA-administered PolSARPro software package, subject to the implementation of a number of recommendations made in the presentation to make the software useful. This version does not implement those recommendations. Hence this version should not be considered intended as useful for any particular purpose other than the author's personal reflection.
