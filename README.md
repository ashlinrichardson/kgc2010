# kgc2010

**KGC** is an **unsupervised classification algorithm** developed w David Goodenough, Hao Chen and team [1] at NRCAN's **Advanced Forest Technologies (AFT) group.** This implementation was initially developed for IGARSS 2010 between April 1 -- August 19th, 2010 while A. Richardson was funded as an M.Sc. student by R. Illner with the U. Victoria Department of Mathematics and Statistics, and is still being improved. Graphics functions are adapted from [2]

## instructions (tested on Ubuntu 20)
To run the example:
```
  ./setup.sh
  
  make
  
  ./run.sh 
```
Detailed instructions for GUI, to follow..
