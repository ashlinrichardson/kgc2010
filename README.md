# kgc2010

**KGC** is an **unsupervised classification algorithm** developed with David Goodenough, Hao Chen and other researchers within the Canadian Forest Service's **Advanced Forest Technologies (AFT) group.** This implementation was developed between April 1 -- August 19th, 2010 for presentation at IGARSS 2020 while the author was funded by the U.Vic Math & Stats department, and is occasionally still being improved. Graphics functions adapted from Nigel Stewart [2].

## instructions (tested on Ubuntu 20)
To run the example:
```
  ./setup.sh
  
  make
  
  ./run.sh 
```
Detailed instructions for GUI, to follow..
.. also documentation of parameters!

# Instructions
## 3d cluster plot
* Zoom: hold down both mouse buttons and drag
* Pan: hold down right mouse button and drag
* Rotate: hold down left mouse button and drag
Click on cluster centres (blue) to visualize cluster in image domain (class window)

## Image plot
Band selection:
* type: r1 (then press return) to set band 1 as red
* type g2 (then press return) to set band 2 as green
* type b3 (then press return) to set band 3 as blue
Similarly, type r3 <return> g2 <return> b1 <return> for (red, green, blue) = (3, 2, 1) instead..
