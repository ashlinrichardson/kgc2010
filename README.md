this software written by A. Richardson April 1, 2010 -- August 19th, 2010 while funded as an M.Sc. student by Dr. R. Illner at the department of Mathematics and Statistics (U. Victoria) is a reinterpretation of a code originally included as one function of a command-line utility "scg" (standing for S. Cloude graphics) written under the supervision of Dr. D. Goodenough and H. Chen at Natural Resources Canada (NRCAN). 

this research direction towards data-driven analysis and implementation w support from Dr. D. Leckie who supervised me as a physics scientist at NRCAN and also by Dr. B. Gooch a first PhD supervisor at U. Victoria. Subsequently the author explored adaptations of related software, to time-series data applications at U. Victoria with Dr. Goodenough as his PhD student, and with physics scientist H. Chen at NRCAN. The author is thankful to all these supports to inspiring a lifelong interest in mathematical modelling, remote sensing, image analysis, and computer vision. 

Special thanks to Dr. Y. Coady who also encouraged this work and was instrumental to my developing a philosophy to always look on the bright side of life. With gratitude I thank D. Marinakis and D. Fairall for welcoming me as part of their community at Kinsol Research and their inspiring leadership.

The command-line utility "scg" implemented a procedure closely related to [1]. "scg" was intended for rapid interactive radar data exploration and included special features for visualizing radar data inspired by the great Dr. S. R. Cloude and physically explanatory radar image visualisation techniques as developed and promoted by him.

This software produced results in a 2010 IGARSS presentation delivered to a full room at the Waikiki Hilton [1] at which the great Prof. Eric Pottier (u. Rennes) invited to submit the software to the ESA-administered PolSARPro software package, subject to the implementation of a number of recommendations made in the presentation.
